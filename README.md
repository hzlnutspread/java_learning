# Java_learning

This is a collection of all the lessons and tutorials I've and notes that I've taken.

This ranges from:

- 12 hour long tutorials
- 30 minute lectures
- Random bits of reading on particular topics I've found from google searches

The idea is to grow out my own personal library so that when I forget something, I can come back here to reference it.
