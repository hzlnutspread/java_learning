Throwable has two subclasses; error and exception.
    Error and exception are separate from eachother

All exceptions in java are subclasses of the exception class e.g. nullpointerexception
    The RunTimeException and all subclasses of this are UNCHECKED exceptions
    Any exception that isnt a runtimeexception is a checked exception including the exception class itself e.g. filenotfoundexception

If we type
    "Throw new Exception(); we will get an error because this is a checked exception

If we type
    "Threw new RunTimeException(); we will not get an error because this is an unchecked exception

Should deal with all exception using try catch anyway.
