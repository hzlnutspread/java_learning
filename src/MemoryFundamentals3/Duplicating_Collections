If we have a collection, referenced by a variable, and we set another variable equal to the collection variable, both variables point to the same object on the heap
If we create a new collection, and pass an existing collection in to the constructor of the new collection, then we create a new object on the heap and a new variable on the stack pointing to the object.
Possible downside, The client is still free to mutate the collection that they have been passed.
The best solution to prevent escaping references is to create an immutable collection
