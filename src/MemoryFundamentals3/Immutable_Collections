Collections.unmodifyableMap
Collections.unmodifyableList
If we pass a collection into one of these, then we will get a version that then can't be edited.
    This avoids the reference escaping from the class

What we do instead of providing a reference to the map, is we provide a copy of the collection that is immutable.
