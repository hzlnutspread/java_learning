Customer cust = (new Customer("John"));
String name = cust.getName();
name = "Simon";

First line creates cust variable on the stack --> points to Customer object with field name on heap --> points to String John on heap
Second line creates name variable on stack --> points to String John immediately.
Third line create new object String "Simon" on the heap and name variable points to this.

So, cust still points to Customer name object which is still pointing to String "John".
the copy of cust variable called name is now pointing to "Simon".
Trying to change the name has not worked.

Wrappers are immutable.
